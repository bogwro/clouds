= clouds

This is a tool that aims to ease the handling of Cloudformation stacks as code.

It implements the following features
 - List existing stacks defined in AWS and also those only defined locally
 - Dumps all the stacks from your account into the current directory 
 (preferably SCN backed) under the 'stacks' directory.
 - Perform updates on the AWS stacks once you modified the dumped data
 - Clone existing stacks to create new ones
 - Delete existing stacks
